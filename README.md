# Cub3D

### The walls have nothing in common, the doors are painfully ugly, no enemies, no jumping, floor and ceiling are smooth and have no patterns
### the mouse movements will make you have suicidal thoughts, the only animation is literal piss and everything will collapse at the slightest misuse of it

## So in short it's better than an EA game
